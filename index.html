                <h2>By Air Supply</h2>
                <p>[Verse 1]</p>
                <p>I came to you and never asked too much</br>
                    Wondering what you would say<br>
                    Hoping you'd understand<br>
                    It's not a role I usually play <br>
                    Don't speak to much of what's been going on<br>
                    The past is over and gone<br>
                    Give me your troubled mind <br>
                    You know it's true<br>
                    I can do so much for you<br>
                    I want you<p> 

                        <p>[Chorus]<p>
                        Having you near me<br>
                        Holding you near me<br>
                        I want you to stay and never go away<br>
                        It's so right, having you near me<br>
                        Holding you near me<br>
                        I'll love you tonight, it feels so right<br>
                        Feels so right



                       <p> [Verse 2]<p>
                       You're brave to say that you'll get lost in love<br>
                       But you've opened your heart to me<br>
                       Underneath all you feel<br>
                       You know how deep our love could be<br>
                       Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go<br>
                       Then I'm leaving it up to you<br>
                       Even a fool would know<br>
                       That I'm not through<br>
                       I can do so much for you<br>
                       I want you<p>



                        <p>[Chorus]<p>
                       Having you near me<br>
                       Holding you near me<br>
                       I want you to stay and never go away<br>
                       It's so right, having you near me<br>
                       Holding you near me<br>
                       I'll love you tonight, it feels so right<br>
                       Feels so right<p>
